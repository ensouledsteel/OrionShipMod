# Orion

Mod for Cobalt Core, adding the Orion ship - a series of 3 smaller ships that relies on evasion to catch the Cobalt Core and escape the time loop!

Three new artifacts, including one for all ships!

# Tactics (Orion Exclusive)
Allows your ships to temporarily change formation, but if you are hit, communications between the ships will falter, and one of your crewmembers will become missing! Additionally, if all 3 crewmembers contribute their skills on a turn, activate both cannons!

# Superiority (Orion Exclusive)
Allows your ships to PERMENENTLY change formation! Additionally, using any 3 cards will activate both cannons!

# Control Bay (All Ship Boss Artifact)
Allows your cockpit to function as a missile bay on your turn! Returns to a cockpit at the end of your turn.

### Known Issues
Tactics and Superiority do not apply missing to modded crew members at the moment - instead, one energy will be subtracted next turn. This is due to limitations with how statuses are handled making handling this cumbersome, and may be fixed in a later version!
